This directory contains code samples for the CP subsystem data structures.

Each sub-module demonstrates a CP data structure and contains a `start.sh`
file, which starts a CP member.

CP data structure code samples require 3 CP members to run, so you need to hit 
`start.sh` from 3 different terminals.

For instance, while you are in this directory, execute 
`cp-atomiclong/start.sh` from 3 terminal instances to run the CP `IAtomicLong` 
code samples.
