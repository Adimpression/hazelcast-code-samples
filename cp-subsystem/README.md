This directory contains code samples for the CP Subsystem.

The CP data structure code samples require 3 CP members to run, so you need to
hit the `start.sh` from 3 different terminals. For instance, while you are in
this directory, execute `cp-atomiclong/start.sh` from 3 terminal instances to 
run the CP `IAtomicLong` code sample.

To run the CP Subsystem management code samples, just hit the `start.sh` script
from a single terminal.
